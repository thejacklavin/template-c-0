# C Module 0: Introduction

## Exercise 0.1
> Use the editor below to write your first C program mimicking the one above, but with a more creative message.

```
// Paste your program here
```

## Exercise 0.2
> Type up and compile the above program.
> What is the compiler error reported?


## Exercise 0.3
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.4
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.5
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.6
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.7
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.8
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.9
> What is the error produced by compiling this program?

## Exercise 0.10
> What kind of a compiler error do you get if you try to use a reserved word as an identifier? Use a reserved word to declare an integer identifier.

## Exercise 0.11
> What happens if you omit the "L" or "LLU" when declaring numStarsInUniverse and largestIntegerInC? What happens if you use `%d` for the largestIntegerInC print statement?

## Exercise 0.12
> Adjust the amount of space used in the printf call. What happens if x has more digits than are reserved? What happens if it has fewer digits?

## Exercise 0.13
> What print command would you use to print PI with a reserved width of 10 characters and only one digit after the decimal place? Does the reserved width include the decimal point and "e+" notation characters?

## Exercise 0.14
> It's a common error to mistype the format string. What happens when you reverse the `%d` and `%f` specifiers in the program above?

## Exercise 0.15
> What happens if you use double quotes when assigning a char? What happens if you put multiple letters within single quotes?

## Exercise 0.16
> Use the ASCII table above to assign `c1` and `c2` to numeric values that represent your initials. Then print them using both the `%d` and `%c` format specifiers.

## Exercise 0.17
> What is the program's output?

## Exercise 0.18
>  Put the following code into the editor below. What does it print out? What is its significance?

## Exercise 0.19
> What happens when you try to modify one of the `const` variables? Is this a compile-time or a run-time error?


## Exercise 0.20
> There is a bug in this code! Why won't it print "i is not 5" like the developer expected? Is this a compile-time or run-time error?


## Exercise 0.21
> Without running it, what is the error in the code?


## Exercise 0.22
> Use for-loops to print "hourglasses" of different sizes. Enter your code here:

```
// Paste your program here

```
